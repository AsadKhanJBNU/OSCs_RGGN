## Bridging Experiment and Deep Learning: RGNN-Based Prediction of electronic properties in OSCs
The adaptability of organic molecules offers an expansive design landscape for organic semiconductors (OSCs) in electronic applications. Among them, OSCs is known due to its exceptional electronic and excellent optoelectronic properties.  Herein, we present a cutting-edge approach using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to investigate energy gaps, HOMO, LUMO, and electronic excitation energies. The ML and DL models were rigorously trained on a dataset of over 48,182 OSCs, utilizing SMILES as input features to enhance model precision. Among these models, the residual-gated graph neural network (RGNN) emerged as the optimal model, effectively predicting key properties and demonstrating superior performance in evaluation metrics. Further, our optimal DL model was validated against experimental data, with results aligning closely with experimental findings, confirming the practical reliability of this approach. Additionally, an RGNN-based Web Server was developed, presenting a computational platform with a user-centric interface for rapid prediction of HOMO, LUMO, and excitation energy levels. This tool offers a streamlined, accessible solution for researchers in the materials science community to facilitate the synthesis of next-generation OSCs, presenting the most reliable computational approach to date.
